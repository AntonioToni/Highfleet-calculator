# Highfleet-calculator

This project was made because my friend decided to manually calculate how much methane (fuel) and money 
it would take to travel from his city to capital city with ship Sevastopol.\
If you don't know what Highfleet is, it is a video game, I highly recommend you check it out <a href="http://koshutin.com/">here</a>.
